    /** 1. Write a method called numberOfVowels that returns the number of vowels in a string.
     Consider a, e, i, o, u as vowels. **/
    

    /** 2. Write a method called notDivisibleBy235 that finds the number of natural numbers not exceeding N
     and not divisible by any of the numbers [2, 3, 5].
     Example
     Let's take the number 5 as an example:
     1 - doesn't divide integer by 2, 3, and 5
     2 - divides integer by 2
     3 - divides integer by 3
     4 - divides integer by 2
     5 - divides integer by 5
     Answer: 1 (only one number doesn't divide integer by any of 2, 3, 5) **/


    /** 3. Write a method called camelCaseMe so that it converts dash/underscore delimited words into camel casing.
     * The first word within the output should be capitalized only if the original word was capitalized
     * (known as Upper Camel Case, also often referred to as Pascal case).
     * The next words should always be capitalized.
     Examples
     "the-stealth-warrior" gets converted to "theStealthWarrior"
     "The_Stealth_Warrior" gets converted to "TheStealthWarrior"
     "The_Stealth-Warrior" gets converted to "TheStealthWarrior" **/
